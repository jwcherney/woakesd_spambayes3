I'm confused - you have a static ip at home, which is your FreeBSD box,
and then you foward those 3 ports to somewhere outside?  Huh?

That sucks.  Have your server listen on another port?

OK here's a couple, the zanier one first.  I thought of them all by
myself!=20

Peer-to-peer distributed lending.  All a bank does is make many smaller
lenders look like one big lender to a borrower, similarly to a lender
(depositor).  Why not get rid of the bank and use the Internet instead?
A bit of automatic discovery, a bit of reputation / persona management,
a bit of electronic cash, and presto, you can lend or borrow at better
rates than the banks can manage because they have all those bricks and
employees to pay for.

Parking.  You're driving along, need to park, no spaces to be had, what
can you do?  On your mobile, dial 1-800-NICKPARK which tells you that Mr
Smith in the next block has his driveway available for the next 4 hrs at
$3/hr.  You hit accept, you park, your credit card is billed.

The details of implementing and making money I leave as an exercise to
the reader :-)
