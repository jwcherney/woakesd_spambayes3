BID WRITING: THE BASICS   Start 09.00  Finish 11.30  Cost £95

Do you know the most common reasons for rejection? Are you gathering the right 
evidence? Are you making the right arguments? Are you using the right 
terminology? Are your numbers right? Are you learning from rejections? Are you 
assembling the right documents? Do you know how to create a clear and concise 
standard funding bid? Are you communicating with people or just excluding them? 
Do you know your own organisation well enough? Are you thinking through your 
projects carefully enough? Do you know enough about your competitors? Are you 
answering the questions funders will ask themselves about your application? Are 
you submitting applications correctly?

BID WRITING: ADVANCED   Start 12.00  Finish 14.30  Cost £95

Are you applying to the right trusts? Are you applying to enough trusts? Are you 
asking for the right amount of money? Are you applying in the right ways? Are 
your projects the most fundable projects? Are you carrying out trust fundraising 
in a professional way? Are you delegating enough work? Are you highly productive 
or just very busy? Are you looking for trusts in all the right places? How do 
you compare with your competitors for funding? Is the rest of your fundraising 
hampering your bids to trusts? Do you understand what trusts are ideally looking 
for?

ATTENDEES  

Staff members, volunteers, trustees or board members of charities, schools or 
public sector organisations who intend to submit grant funding applications to
charitable grant making trusts and foundations. People who provide advice to these
organisations are also welcome.
